      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        India (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat
        Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most
        populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most
        populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the
        south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the
        southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China,
        Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.
        In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
        Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with
        Thailand and Indonesia.

        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later
        than 55,000 years ago.[24] Their long occupation, initially in varying
        forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly
        diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled
        life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus
        river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley
        Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE, an archaic
        form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India
        from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and
        recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[27] The Dravidian languages
        of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[28] By 400
        BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within
        Hinduism,[29] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social
        orders unlinked to heredity.
